# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Predictor

Welcome to the **Student Performance Predictor** project! This repository provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing and predicting student performance using various data science techniques. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning models, and a Flask web application for interactive results.

### ðŸ“Š What We Did

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We performed data exploration and visualization to uncover insights and understand factors influencing student performance. This process is detailed in the **Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb** notebook.

2. **Model Creation**: We developed predictive models to estimate student performance based on various factors. The **Modelling.ipynb** notebook covers the model training and evaluation process.

3. **Flask Web Application**: We built a Flask app to present the results interactively. Users can input their data and receive predictions via the web interface.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kom-senapati/Student-Performance-Predictor.git
   cd Student-Performance-Predictor
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**
   Install the required packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   cd Codes-Programs-Database
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv/Scripts/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run EDA and Model Code**
   Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in `Codes-Programs-Database/Notebooks/` to explore the data and build models.

4. **Start the Flask App**
   Navigate to `Codes-Programs-Database/Website-Code/` and run:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This will start the Flask server, and you can access the app at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
